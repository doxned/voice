# What is VC Client

1. This is a client software for performing real-time voice conversion using various Voice Conversion (VC) AI. The supported AI for voice conversion are as follows.

- [RVC(Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion)](https://github.com/liujing04/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI)
- [Beatrice JVS Corpus Edition](https://prj-beatrice.com/) * experimental,  (***NOT MIT License*** see [readme](https://github.com/w-okada/voice-changer/blob/master/server/voice_changer/Beatrice/)) *  Only for Windows, CPU dependent

1. Distribute the load by running Voice Changer on a different PC
   The real-time voice changer of this application works on a server-client configuration. By running the MMVC server on a separate PC, you can run it while minimizing the impact on other resource-intensive processes such as gaming commentary.

1. Cross-platform compatibility
   Supports Windows, Mac (including Apple Silicon M1), Linux, and Google Colaboratory.

1. We provide a REST API.

- You can operate it using HTTP clients that are built into the OS, such as curl.
- This allows you to easily achieve the following:
  - Users can register processes that call the REST API in shortcuts, such as in .bat files.
  - Create simple clients to operate remotely.
  - And more.
